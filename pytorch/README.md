# Learning Pytorch on an Apple Silicon Mac

From [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org) and the special instructions for running
with Apple Silicon from [James
Brigg](https://towardsdatascience.com/gpu-acceleration-comes-to-pytorch-on-m1-macs-195c399efcc1)
and
[Nikos](https://towardsdatascience.com/installing-pytorch-on-apple-m1-chip-with-gpu-acceleration-3351dc44d67c)
for how to use Jupyterlab with it.

This requires PyTorch v1.12
